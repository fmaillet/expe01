```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
f <- list.files(pattern="subject-\\d+\\.csv")

n = length(f)
```

## Introduction

This is the analysis results of all the concurrent tasks pre-test.
`r n` volunteers participate in this pre-test.


 

```{r}
a = 3
a
pi
```

## Spatial task

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
